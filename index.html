        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a product designer who blends curiosity with a deep focus on
          product thinking. I enjoy designing early-stage 0 → 1 products and
          simplifying complex workflows into simple interfaces. Most recently, I
          designed the entire digital product experience at Earnnest. I’ve also
          worked with companies like FlytBase, GetMega, and Quizizz. Beyond
          screens, I build skateboarding communities and teach design
          occasionally.
